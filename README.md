Project Overview
The Password Strength Checker helps you check how strong your password is. It compares your password to security rules and gives feedback to help you create safer, more secure passwords for your online accounts.

Features
Password Evaluation: The checker assesses the password based on the following:
Minimum length requirement (at least 8 characters)
Presence of numbers
Use of uppercase letters
Inclusion of special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)
Strength Feedback: The checker provides one of three feedback results:
Weak: The password doesn't meet security standards.
Moderate: The password is somewhat secure but could be improved.
Strong: The password meets all necessary criteria for a strong password.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple, clean, and responsive design for easy use.
Technologies
HTML: Used for building the webpage structure.
CSS: Used for styling the page and making it responsive.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for checking password strength and providing feedback.
